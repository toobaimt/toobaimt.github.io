I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), working with the [Machine Learning group @ SPIRAL](https://mllabneu.github.io/) supervised by [Professor Jennifer Dy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6h7b0fAAAAAJ&hl=en). My current research interests include 3D computer vision (particularly 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis), generative modeling, continual learning, adversarial attacks, and leveraging them for interpretability. Additionally, I have worked on unsupervised 3D reconstruction and classification, time-series forecasting and implicit neural networks. 

Previously, I interned with Google Pixel Biometrics AI Research (BAIR) team, where I worked on multi-view diffusion models. I also interned with Google's Project Starline (now Google Beam) and developed a novel feed-forward framework for efficient and scalable 3D reconstruction and NVS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in a single inference pass.

Besides my academic interests, I enjoy community service and reading biographies.

## Research Interests
- 3D computer vision (reconstruction, diffusion models)
- Adversarial attacks for robust and interpretable ML
- 3D object detection, representation learning and reconstruction
- 2D object detection, segmentation and tracking
